# find_it_fix_it

Find it Fix it (FiFi) is an app to report selected issues to the City of Seattle. 
The current project aims to analyse the data and predict the future complaints that the City of Seattle could anticipate.

Items in pipeline:

## Phase 1 (In-progress):
- Predict number of requests that can be expected on a daily basis


## Phase 2:
- Predict number of requests that can be expected on a daily basis in each neighbourhood.
- Predict the category of request that could be requested from each neighbourhood.

## Phase 3:
- NLP: Come up with the request content in each category that could be expected (could be a fun project)

## Phase 4:
- Scale this to hourly predictions.
